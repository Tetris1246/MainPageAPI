# MainPageAPI
## What is it?
MainPageAPI is a sort of tool for creating your own mainpage with own icons...
## Why it exists
MainPageAPI exists, because some time ago i made [this](https://tetris1246.github.io/) page and after i shared it to my classmates, everyone wanted just this one link replaced with another and so on. That's the reason i developed this API.
After a quick research i did not find a API like this one. Thats the reason why i published this. 

# Documentation for V2 will be made soon!
